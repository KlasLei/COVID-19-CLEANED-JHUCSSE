# Cleaned Daily Reports (csse_covid_19_daily_reports)

This folder contains cleaned daily reports from CSSE JHU. Unlike CSSE JHU's raw csv files, every file in this folder consists of the same variables. These variables adopt a consistent naming scheme and order that will not change (although new variables may be added sequentially). Cleaned daily reports will be added daily to this folder to reflect the latest additions and updates from JHU CSSE. 

**A record of changes is recorded below.**

### **Variable Names**

The following columns are found in every csv file in this order:

1. Date_Published *
2. FIPS                
2. Admin2             
3. Province_State      
4. Country_Region      
5. Last_Updated         
6. Latitude            
7. Longitude                    
8. Confirmed 
9. Deaths 
10. Recovered 
11. Active            
12. Combined_Key   

New variables will be added **IF and WHEN** JHU CSSE make changes. However, the above variables and their names will not change. If JHU CSSE introduce new variables, these will be added *sequentially* to the variables above. 

> Note: * `Date_Published` is the only variable above that is unique to this repository. It is used for data wrangling; to keep track of daily reports. Note then that the dates record in `Date_Published` may differ from those recorded in `Last_Update`. The latter ought to be used for time series analysis. 

### **What else is different?**

* `Last_Update` fixes inconsistencies in how dates and times were formatted across csv files. 
     * All timestamps are in UTC (GMT+0) and adopt a standard M/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS POSIXct format.
* Blank cells indicating an absence of COVID-19 `Confirmed`, `Deaths`, and `Recovered` cases are replace with zeros. (Preventing programs like R from treating these as missing values).
